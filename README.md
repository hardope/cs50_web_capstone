# Distinctiveness and Complexity

I am convinced that my project satisfies the distinctiveness requirements because it is not similar in any way to any of the web applications we have developed so far.<br>

I believe this project satisfies the complexity requiment for several reasons. One of the requirements states that the project must utilize Django (using at least One model) on the back-end and JavaScript on the front-end, This requirement is met as I used the Django Framework and used the Reaction Model to store the upvotes and downvotes for each word in the dictionary. Also JavaScript is used on the front-end to send an Http request to the backend to update the upvote or downvote and edit the values displayed on the pages in respect to the button clicked.

### The web applications Developed During Cs50WEB:

* A Google search clone
* A project similar to wikipedia that enables us to create an article with a markdown system and edit it.
* A Bid auction website
* A SPA (single page app) - mail app
* A network App in which we can create/like a post, edit our own post and follow/unfollow other users.

### Details & usage:
on loading the default page a random word is selected and displayed alongside its definition and word type. This is achieved by calling some functions from the operations.py file, a word is returned along side its meaning and definition, This word is then passed Into the Html file using Jinja templating engine.<br>

The Search textbox is used to find words. After The search button is filled and a request is sent to the server, the view in question fetches the user input and redirects to the view word route<br>

There's also the Upvote and Downvote button which calls respective javascript functions to send a request to update the server data. The purpose of this function is to enable users to tell if a definition is correct or not depending on the ratio of upvote to downvotes provided by people who previously viewed the words and its definition.
